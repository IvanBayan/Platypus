FPGA Development
================

I rarely see projects that document the trials and tribulations of FPGA and digital design developement.  I was always looking for 'how a project develops'.  The closely thing I found was the USRP.  So I plan to do a **really** good job here.  I am very new to digital design and hopefully other *noobs* will find this useful.
