Hardware Design
===============

This is where I will place all of my hardware design files and notes as I develop this device.  It will be useful for anyone who comes behind me to know what I was thinking.  Most of the schematics and pcbs will be designed in Altium. I know its not free.  But I like it! The designs will be licensed open source so if someone want to come up behind me an convert them to eagle or kicad, feel free!
