Machine Learning & Signal Processing
====================================

To be honest I expect Newton to fill alot of this in as he will be figuring out how to solve thie *problem*.  The idea is some what knew. Classically electrical impedance sensing systems tried to solve for the properties of the environment.  This *is* computationally intensive.  We plan to do it *different* and instead learn from the signals what objects do to the field.
