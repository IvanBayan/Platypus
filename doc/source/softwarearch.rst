Software Design
===============

This is where I will discuss the software design.  Mostly it will be a wrapper ontop of the libftdi.  
I will be putting a demo together of using libftdi, the Ft2232H chip and an FPGA for streaming data at 40+MB/s!
I have done this but not documented it.
Then I will write my own software *hopefully* cross platform that will allow any system to access the data from the DAQ.
